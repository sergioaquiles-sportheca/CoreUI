import SwiftUI

/// A SwiftUI view that asynchronously loads and displays an image from a URL with persistent disk caching.
///
/// `CachedAsyncImage` first attempts to retrieve an image from a persistent cache (`PersistentImageCache`).
/// If the image is not cached, it downloads it using `URLSession`, stores it in the cache, and then displays it.
/// While the image is loading (or when no URL is provided), the placeholder view is shown.
///
/// The view is driven by SwiftUI state and automatically reloads when the `url` changes.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```swift
/// CachedAsyncImage(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/image.jpg")) { image in
///     image
///         .resizable()
///         .scaledToFill()
/// } placeholder: {
///     ProgressView()
/// }
/// .frame(width: 120, height: 120)
/// .clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12))
/// ```
///
/// - Note: Images are cached using `PersistentImageCache.shared`. The cache implementation is expected to be
///   thread-safe and persist images between app launches. Errors during download are printed to the console.
